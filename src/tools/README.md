# Tools

Apart from the simulator itself, many tools have been developed to help users or extend the model.

These tools include:

- [A script to compute time-dependent routing queries](routing_script.md)
- A script to import a network from OpenStreetMap data
- A script to import a network from HERE data
- A script to add connectors to a network
- A script to compute air pollution from the results of a simulation
