## CSV / Parquet representation

In METROPOLIS2, **agents** can choose between various **travel alternatives**, where each travel
alternative is composed of one or more **trips**.
Following this hierarchy, the population input is divided in three files:

- `agents.parquet` (or `agents.csv`)
- `alts.parquet` (or `alts.csv`)
- `trips.parquet` (or `trips.csv`)

### Agents

| Column | Data type | Conditions | Constraints | Description |
| ------ | --------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `agent_id` | `Integer` | Mandatory | No duplicate value, no negative value | Identifier of the agent (used to match with the alternatives and used in the output) |
| `alt_choice.type` | `String` | Optional | Possible values: `"Logit"`, `"Deterministic"` | Type of choice model for the choice of an alternative (See [Discrete choice model](#discrete-choice-model)). If `null`, the agent always chooses the first alternative. |
| `alt_choice.u` | `Float` | Mandatory if `alt_choice.type` is `"Logit"`, optional if `alt_choice.type` is `"Deterministic"`, ignored otherwise | Between `0.0` and `1.0` | Standard uniform draw to simulate the chosen alternative using [inverse transform sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling). For a deterministic choice, it is only used in case of tie and the default value is `0.0` (i.e., the first value is chosen in case of tie). |
| `alt_choice.mu` | `Float` | Mandatory if `alt_choice.type` is `"Logit"`, ignored otherwise | Positive number | Variance of the stochastic terms in the utility function, larger values correspond to "more stochasticity" |
| `alt_choice.constants` | `List` of `Float` | Optional if `alt_choice.type` is `"Deterministic"`, ignored otherwise | | Constant value added to the utility of each alternative. Useful to simulate a Multinomial Logit model (or any other discrete-choice model) with randomly drawn values for the stochastic terms. If the number of constants does not match the number of alternatives, the constants are cycled over. |

| `pre_compute_route` | `Boolean` | Optional | | When this alternative is selected, if `true` (default), the routes (for all road trips of this alternative) are computed before the day start.

### Additional constraints

- At least one alternative in `alts.parquet` for each `agent_id` in `agents.parquet`.
- For each trip in `trips.parquet`, a corresponding pair `(agent_id, alt_id)` must exist in
  `alts.parquet`.

## Modeling considerations

### No-trip alternatives

It is not mandatory to have at least one trip for each alternative.
When there is an alternative with no trip, the agent will simply not travel during the simulated
day.
The `constant_utility` parameter can be used at the alternative-level to set the utility of the
alternative.

### Discrete Choice Model

In METROPOLIS2, there are two types of discrete choice models: **Deterministic** and **Logit**.

#### Deterministic choice model

With a deterministic choice model, the alternative with the largest utility is chosen.

A deterministic choice model can have up to two parameters: `u` and `constants`.
The parameter `u` must be a `float` between `0.0` and `1.0`.
This parameter is only used in case of tie (there are two or more alternatives with the exact same
utility).
If there are two such alternatives, the first one is chosen if `u <= 0.5`; the second one is chosen
otherwise.
If there are three such alternatives, the first one is chosen is `u <= 0.33`; the second one is
chosen if `0.33 < u <= 0.67`; and the third one is chosen otherwise.
And so on for 4 or more alternatives.

The parameter `constants` is a list of values which are added to the utility of each alternative
before the choice is computed.
If the number of constants does not match the number of alternatives, the values are cycled over.
For example, assume that there are three alternatives with utility `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`.
If the given constants are `[0.1, 0.5]`, then the final utilities used to make the choice will be:
`[1.1, 2.5, 3.1]` (the first constant is used twice).
If the given constants are `[0.1, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9]`, then the final utilities used to make the choice
will be: `[1.1, 2.5, 3.7]` (the last constant is ignored).
A few considerations should be noted:

- The constants can be used to represent the draws of random perturbations in a discrete-choice
  model. For example, to simulate a Probit in METROPOLIS2, you can draw as many Gaussian random
  variables as there are alternatives and put the draws in the `constants` parameter.
- For travel alternatives (`alt_choice.type`), it is recommended to add the constant value to the
  utility of the alternative directly (`constant_utility` parameter). This is not possible however
  when using a deterministic choice model for the departure-time choice (`dt_choice.model.type`).
- It is recommended to set as many constants as there are alternatives to prevent confusion.
- In the output, the constant value for the selected alternative is not return in the `utility` of
  this alternative. It is part of the `expected_utility` however.


#### Logit choice model

With a Logit choice model, alternatives are chosen with a probability given by the Multinomial Logit
formula:

\\[
    p\_j = \frac{e^{V\_j / \mu}}{\sum_{j'} e^{V\_{j'} / \mu}}.
\\]

A Logit choice model has two parameters:

- `u` (`float` between `0.0` and `1.0`)
- `mu` (`float` larger than `0.0`)

The parameter `mu` represents the variance of the extreme-value distributed random terms in the
Logit theory.

The parameter `u` indicates how the alternative is chosen from the Logit probabilities (See [Inverse
transform sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling)).

### Departure-Time Choice

There are three possible types for the departure-time choice of an alternative: Constant, Discrete,
Continuous.

#### Constant

There is no choice, the departure time for the alternative is always equal to the given
departure-time (`dt_choice.departure_time`).

The `expected_utility` of this alternative is equal to the utility computed for this departure time,
using the expected travel time.

#### Discrete

The agent chooses a departure-time among various departure-time intervals, of equal length.

The choice intervals depends on the parameters `dt_choice.period` and `dt_choice.interval`.
For example, if the period is [08:00, 09:00] and the interval is 20 minutes, the choice intervals
are [08:00, 08:20], [08:20, 08:40] and [08:40, 09:00].
The choice is then computed based on the expected utilities at the center of the intervals (i.e., at
08:10, 08:30 and 08:50 in the example), using a [Discrete choice model](#discrete-choice-model).

The `dt_choice.offset` parameter can be used to shift the selected departure time.
For example, if the agent selects the interval [08:20, 08:40] and the offset is `-120`, the selected
departure time will be 08:28 (the center 08:30, minus 2 minutes for the offset).
It is recommended to set the offset value to uniform draws in the interval `[-interval_length / 2,
interval_length / 2]` so that the departure times are uniformly spread in the chosen departure
time intervals.

#### Continuous

A departure time is chosen with a probability given by the Continuous Logit formula:

\\[
    p(t) = \frac{e^{V(t) / \mu}}{\int\_{t\_0}^{t\_1} e^{V(\tau) / \mu} \text{d} \tau},
\\]

where \\( [t\_0, t\_1] \\) is the period of the departure-time choice (parameter
`dt_choice.period`).

The only possible choice model for a continuous departure-time choice is `"Logit"`, with parameters
`u` and `mu`.

### Trip types

There are two types of trips: road and virtual.

#### Road trips

Road trips represent a trip on the road network from a given origin to a given destination, using a
given vehicle type.
The parameter `class.route` can be used to force the vehicle to follow a route.

#### Virtual trips

Virtual trips represent a trip with an exogenous travel time (independent of the other agents'
choices).
