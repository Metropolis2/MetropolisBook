# Getting Started

This chapter of the book teaches [how to write and understand the input files](input/index.html),
[how to run the simulator]() and [how to read and understand the output files](output/README.md).
It is intended for the users that want to run small- or large-scale simulations with METROPOLIS2.
It can be read in any order.
The users should not be afraid to skip some sections and come back to them when needed.
